## Introduction
System health monitoring involves tracking critical performance metrics, resources, and activities to ensure a Linux system remains functional and optimized. Effective monitoring can help prevent downtime, optimize resource usage, and provide insights into the system's performance over time.

## System Health Monitoring Components

### CPU Usage
Monitoring CPU usage helps identify if processes are overloading the CPU. High CPU usage can lead to slowdowns or system crashes.

**Commands to Monitor CPU Usage:**
- `top`: Displays ongoing CPU usage for processes.
- `htop`: An enhanced version of `top` with a more user-friendly interface.
- `mpstat`: Provides detailed CPU usage for each core.

### Memory Usage
Tracking memory usage is crucial for ensuring applications have enough memory resources without causing excessive swapping.

**Commands to Monitor Memory Usage:**
- `free -m`: Shows memory usage in megabytes.
- `vmstat`: Displays memory, swap, and cache information.
- `smem`: Provides a detailed view of memory consumption per process.

### Disk Usage
Disk usage monitoring helps identify potential storage issues. Disk space should be managed to avoid running out of space, which can cause services to fail.

**Commands to Monitor Disk Usage:**
- `df -h`: Displays disk space usage in a human-readable format.
- `du -sh /directory`: Shows the size of a specific directory.
- `iostat`: Provides disk I/O statistics.

### Network Activity
Monitoring network activity is essential for troubleshooting connectivity issues and ensuring sufficient bandwidth.

**Commands to Monitor Network Activity:**
- `netstat`: Provides information on network connections.
- `iftop`: Displays bandwidth usage per network connection.
- `nload`: Provides a visual representation of incoming and outgoing network traffic.

### System Logs
System logs record important system events, which are invaluable for troubleshooting and security monitoring.

**Important Log Files:**
- `/var/log/syslog`: General system log.
- `/var/log/auth.log`: Authentication logs.
- `/var/log/kern.log`: Kernel logs.

## Monitoring Tools

### Built-in Linux Commands
Linux provides a range of commands for quick system monitoring. These are often lightweight and can be used in scripts for automated health checks.
- `top`, `htop`: CPU and memory usage.
- `free`, `vmstat`, `iostat`: Memory and I/O statistics.
- `df`, `du`: Disk usage.
- `ps`, `netstat`: Process and network monitoring.

### External Monitoring Tools
Several advanced tools provide a centralized view of system health and alerts for potential issues.

1. **Nagios**: Monitors system status, performance, and log files.
2. **Prometheus & Grafana**: Collects metrics and visualizes them in dashboards.
3. **Zabbix**: Provides comprehensive monitoring with alerting and data visualization.
4. **Glances**: Displays real-time system stats in a concise, user-friendly interface.

## Automating Monitoring Tasks
To avoid manual checks, automated tasks can be scheduled with **cron jobs** or **systemd timers** to monitor the system at regular intervals.

### Example Cron Job for CPU Monitoring:
```bash
*/5 * * * * top -b -n1 | grep "Cpu(s)" >> /var/log/cpu_usage.log
