# Let's Go Phishing - Solo Mode

## Introduction
This project focuses on understanding phishing techniques and security best practices. By creating a simulated phishing login page using HTML and CSS, you will explore how attackers can collect sensitive information like usernames and passwords.

## How to Start

### Objective
Reproduce a realistic-looking web login form to understand phishing mechanisms. Learn to capture the submitted data using tools like Webhook.site.

### Technologies Used
1. **HTML**: Used to create the structure of the web form.
2. **CSS**: Applied to enhance the appearance of the form.

## Instructions

1. **Setup the Login Page**:
   - Use the provided `Login.html` file for the login form.
   - Style the form using the `styles.css` file.

2. **Capture Form Data**:
   - Sign up on [Webhook.site](https://webhook.site/) to obtain a unique webhook URL.
   - Replace the `action` attribute in the `Login.html` form with the generated webhook URL.
   - Host or open the HTML file locally in a browser.

3. **Submit Test Data**:
   - Enter test credentials in the login form and submit.
   - Check the Webhook.site dashboard for captured data.

4. **Analyze Captured Data**:
   - Review the submitted form fields in the Webhook.site interface.
